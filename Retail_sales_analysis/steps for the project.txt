🔹 Step 1: Get the Dataset
Download the Superstore dataset:

Kaggle Link (or search: “Sample Superstore dataset Kaggle”)

The file is usually a .csv or .xlsx

Save it locally with a clear name like Superstore_Sales_Data.xlsx

🔹 Step 2: Understand the Dataset
Explore the columns. Key ones include:

Order Date, Ship Date

Region, State, City

Category, Sub-Category, Product Name

Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity

Customer Name, Segment

Familiarize yourself with:

What each column represents

Which columns are numerical vs categorical

🔹 Step 3: Data Cleaning (in Excel)
Do this in a separate sheet called "Cleaned Data".

Remove duplicates

Check for blanks/nulls

Format:

Dates as Short Date

Currency columns like Sales, Profit

Fix inconsistent data entries (e.g., spelling errors, extra spaces using TRIM())

🔹 Step 4: Basic Analysis Using Pivot Tables
Go to a new sheet called "Pivot Analysis".

Create Pivot Tables to answer these questions:

✅ Sales performance

Total Sales & Profit by Region

Sales by Category and Sub-Category

Top 10 products by Sales and Profit

✅ Profitability

Products with highest/lowest profit

State-level profit analysis

Discounts vs. Profit — are big discounts hurting profits?

✅ Customer Segment Analysis

Profit by Segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)

Use slicers (filters) for Region, Category, etc.

🔹 Step 5: Create Visualizations
Use Pivot Charts:

Bar charts (Sales by Region)

Line chart (Sales over time)

Pie chart (Segment-wise sales)

Map (if available) to show state-wise performance (optional)

Make a clean, single-page Dashboard sheet with:

KPI Cards (Total Sales, Profit, Quantity)

Key charts

Filters for Region, Segment, etc.

🔹 Step 6: Insights & Conclusions
On a new sheet called "Insights", write 4–6 bullet points:

“The West region generated the highest profit despite fewer orders.”

“Office Supplies had high sales but low margins due to heavy discounting.”

“The Corporate segment had the highest average order value.”

This shows your ability to interpret data, not just crunch numbers.

🔹 Step 7: Optional - Expand to Power BI or Tableau
If you want to upgrade the visual appeal and interactivity:

Load the Excel file into Power BI

Create interactive dashboards with filters, slicers, drill-throughs

Publish your dashboard and link it in your resume
